# Basics Check

In `Check.java`, there is some code that fills a `Double` `ArrayList` with random values between `0.0` and `100.0` (including `0.0`, not including `100.0`). Use algorithms to print out the average, minimum, maximum, and mode of the array.

Then, use algorithms to determine and print out the number of values that are above `50.0`.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
