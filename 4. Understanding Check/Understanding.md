# Understanding Check

As children grow up, they learn more vocabulary and can read more advanced books. In this problem you have been given a sample of a story and the vocabulary of a child.

You are going to write the `missingWords` method that will evalute the story and the vocabulary and print out all of the words that are present in the story but are missing in the child's vocabulary.

The method has two parameters: `story` and `vocab`, which are `String` `ArrayList` objects that contain all of the unique words in the story, and all of the unique words in the child's vocabulary respectively. You need to write an algorithm that determines which words are present in the story, but are not present in the vocabulary. This method is `void`, as it should print out the result.

This is the expected printed result when done correctly (order does not matter as long as all of the following words are present):

```
a
wife
build
room
dishes
dark
side
tree
not
away
orphan
laugh
know
what
north
wail
their
up
follow
tipped
rocked
gently
crawled
closed
```

Hint: Go through each word in the story and check if it matches any of the words in the vocab. If it doesn't this is a new word and needs to be printed.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
