# You Do

Create an `ArrayList` of `10` random `Integer` values between `-10` and `10`, inclusive.

Use algorithms to reverse the order of the random `ArrayList`. Print out the values before and after to be sure it reverses properly.

Use algorithms to shift all of the values to left by 3 slots. Print out the values before and after to be sure it shifts properly.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
